# Streamlit-app

Hello everyone, this repository is dedicated to sharing elements about the streamlit app 'Travel Retrospective' as part of the Data Management training at PSB. This repository includes the datasets used, the notebooks unabling you to clean your data and the code generating the app.

### Purpose of the app
This visualization app allows you to analyse your travel data: the places you have been, how many pictures taken during trips & your health activity. 

### Datasets 
- Apple Health dataset in xml (extracted from Apple Health iPhone app)
- Dataset generated from picture's metadata (folder of picture in xmp format)

### Structure of the app
- Main page: Dashboard with map, charts, and key metrics 
- Page 2: Page for creating your own dashboard 

### Method
For creating the app, there are 3 steps:
1) Exporting data 
2) Cleaning & data exploitation using python on Jupyter notebooks
3) Building the dashboard using streamlit
